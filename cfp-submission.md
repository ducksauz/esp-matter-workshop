# Making IoT devices with ESP32 and Matter

What's the hot new thing in IoT these days? How about an open source connectivity standard around which the industry seems to be converging? It's called Matter and it's supported by Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung. Most importantly, it gives device manufacturers a single standard to develop and test against.

In this workshop, we'll get a development environment up and running using Espressif's ESP-IDF and ESP Matter SDKs. We'll learn about using development containers to maintain a consistent build environment regardless of host platform. We'll build some sample applications, flash them onto an ESP32 device, and add them to a test environment in the workshop. Along the way, I'll give an overview of home automation standards over the years. You'll go home with an ESP32 device configured as a Matter light or sensor and the the ability to develop your own IoT devices.

This is an intermediate workshop. There will be no soldering, but you will need a Linux, Mac, or Windows laptop with git, esptool, Visual Studio Code, and Docker Desktop installed. You'll also want to download the 18 gig development container before coming to the workshop so you're not dependant on conference wifi for that. You'll be given clear instructions in advance of the conference of what you need to prepare.

## What you'll get

* Two (2) ESP32-C6 dev boards with Wifi, BLE, and Thread support

## What you'll need

* A laptop preconfigured with the workshop tools
* Two USB-C cables to program and monitor the ESP32 board with your laptop

## About the instructor

John Duksta is an Elder Nerd who's been a security engineer for over 25 years. He has been messing around with electronics on and off since he was a kid, when his dad got him one of those 150-in-1 electronics experimenter kits at Radio Shack. He is by no means an expert in these things and is hacking his way through this Matter stuff with just a few months head start on the rest of you. He's always happy to share what he's learned along the way.

## Administrativa

This is a 2-3 hour workshop. There will be a little bit of presentation at the beginning, but most of the time will be walking folks through using the tooling and troubleshooting people's issues with it.
